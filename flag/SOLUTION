We are facing a 64bit binary.
After trying 'strings flag' or 'objdump -d flag' we
can observe a strange behaviour. That's because the
binary is packed using UPX. 'strings flag | grep UPX'
will tell us that the file is indeed compressed.
For decompression 'upx -d flag'. After that, we
can run again 'strings flag | grep UPX' and see the flag.
