ssh col@pwnable.kr -p2222 (pw:guest)

The binary expects 20 bytes as argument.
Inside the 'check_password' function, out of the all
20 bytes, 5 integers(4 bytes) are summed up. The 
resulting sum must equal the hashcode value(0x21DD09EC),
which can be split as 4 * 0x6c5cec8 + 0x6c5cecc.
The full payload is created inside the 'tool.py' file,
taking the endianess into account.
