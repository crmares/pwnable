ssh fd@pwnable.kr -p2222 (pw: guest)

The binary expects one argument.
The argument is subtracted from 0x1234(decimal 4660) and
the result is a fd used for reading. We want the fd to 0(STDIN)
so the argument should be exactly 4660. Executing "./fd 4660" will
make the program exect input. The input should be the string "LETMEWIN"
in order to get the flag.
